# 2048-AI-Solver

An implementation of the game 2048 in python and an AI algorithm to solve it.

**USING PyPy IS RECOMMENDED TO RUN AI**

Run ’2048.py’ in the command line to start the game and test the AI. You navigate the menu by using numbers 1-4. The numbers of random run the AI uses in its monte carlo simulations can be set by pressing 1, or will be dynamically set by the AI if you enable that option by pressing 2. 

We recommend running with 10-15 runs if not using PyPy, or 75-100 if using PyPy. Test and compare with runs from 1-10 to see how the AI learns.
