**Usage**

1. Use the command `pypy 2048.py` in the command line to run the program. _(If you dont have PyPy installed, you can run the program with `python 2048.py`, but it's not reccomended)_ 
2. Set the number of runs per move by pressing 1 on your keyboard, or press 2 to use dynamic mode. I reccomend running with 10-15 runs if you're not using PyPy, or 75-100 if you are. Dynamic mode only reccomended if using PyPy
3. Press 3 to run the AI
